implement random searches
  use a google chrome extension
    - really simple to install
    - uses the browser itself - harder to detect
    - makes more sense to the user


steps:

1.  generate queries and execute them
  use a feed - 

2.  let the key press emulation for later
  see if google responds negatively
    if so emulate key actions
