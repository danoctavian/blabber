need to do:
  ** html ui in a different tab
      chrome-extension://dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb/pages/options.html
  ** content script

emulate user activity in the chromium browser...
register typying in textboxes and clicks on links
  most stuff is this

new idea - incongnito identification through typing patterns and search terms
  can compromise anonimity?!; can you fingerprint a person based on this?
  easy to alter - not a real problem if you are aware of it
  prolly not a real issue
