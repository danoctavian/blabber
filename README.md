## Blabber
####blabber on... 

generates randomized searches in your browser to confuse google about your
actual searches.

### Useful code

#### blabberExtension

chrome extension achieves the above. It's a first working draft.

needs refinement for how it generates searches:
  * not just a bag of words but a proper phrase extracted from the feeds
  * keyword typing matches a human typing pattern
  * search rate needs randomization

#### server
research purposes; user actions are sent there too see if there noticeable patterns
in the way a person types to make the bot mimic that. eventually the functionality
(typing pattern imitation) should be integrated in the extension.

=======================


### Researchy code
####blockingResearch

are some scripts used to see how to crawl google through tor
and also see how google decides to block a user or not based on his searches.


####activityGenerator
doesn't belong here. they are some automation scripts for 
doing actions on the google website.
